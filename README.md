#LexisCode Simple Calculator App

This was developed by me in the year 2020; and on learning Git/GitHub
this year 2022, I've chosen to push it to the control system for public
access.

The languages I used: HTML, CSS and JavaScript

You can send me an email (nwokoriealex20@gmail.com) to request for the APK (android) version of this project. I'd forward it to you immediately for your testing. Btw, that also was done using the Andriod Studio editor (some extra JAVA language was added though).

Your feedbacks will be very much appreciated too :)

Happy coding!!
